// If you know a solutions is not far from the root of a tree:
// BFS, it starts searching in the closest nodes to the root.

// If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:
// BFS, DFS will take longer.

// If the tree is very wide:
// DFS, BFS will take much memory.

// If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
// DFS, it could be quicker than BFS.

// Determining whether a path exists between two nodes
// DFS, it focuses on specific routes at a time.

// Finding the shortest path
// BFS, it explores multiple routes.
